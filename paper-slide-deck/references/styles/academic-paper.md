Professional academic presentation style for conference talks, thesis defense, and research presentations

## Design Aesthetic

Clean, professional academic presentation aesthetic. Precise diagrams and charts with clear data visualization. White or light gray backgrounds with restrained color usage. Formal typography hierarchy suitable for academic venues. Think ICML/NeurIPS/CVPR presentation standards.

## Background

- Color: Pure White (#FFFFFF) or Light Gray (#F8FAFC)
- Texture: None - clean and distraction-free

## Typography

### Primary Font (Headlines)

Clean serif font for formal academic authority. Bold weight for main titles. Professional, scholarly presence similar to Times or Georgia.

### Secondary Font (Labels)

Sans-serif for diagram labels, axis titles, and annotations. Clear, readable at small sizes. Consistent weight throughout.

### Body Font

Sans-serif for body text, bullet points, and descriptions. Clean and modern for readability. Proper spacing for dense information.
